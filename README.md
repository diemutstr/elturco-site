# El-Turco Website

This repository has the source for the whole site. It also includes some scripts to generate images and various other things.

The relevant URLs for the *new* contents is as follows:

* [`https://diemut.barzilay.org/new`](https://diemut.barzilay.org/new): Eli's playground.

  This usually has half-assed things which are used to debug new work.  **Do not share!**

* [`https://diemutstr.github.io/elturco-site/new/`](https://diemutstr.github.io/elturco-site/new/): GitHub pages.

  This is hosted on GitHub Pages, and it is updated automatically when new updates are added to the `main` branch.

  Can also be [triggered manually](https://github.com/diemutstr/elturco-site/actions/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml).

* [`https://elturco.diemutstrebe.com/new/`](https://elturco.diemutstrebe.com/new/): the actual site.

  The `new` directory (only!) is updated automatically whenever updates are pushed to the `prod` branch.

  Can also be [triggered manually](https://github.com/diemutstr/elturco-site/actions/workflows/deploy-prod.yml).

All of these URLs end with `/new` â€” drop that, and you'll get the old contents, until we replace that in the near future.

The two automated actions have their status badges at the top of this text.
